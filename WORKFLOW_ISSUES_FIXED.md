# Workflow Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🔴 Issues Found in Logs

### 1. ❌ Datadog CI Not Installed
```
⚠️  /tmp/datadog-ci.sh not found, trying manual installation...
❌ npm not available, cannot install datadog-ci
```
**Cause**: Runner container doesn't have Node.js/npm installed

### 2. ❌ Tests Failing
```
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
⚠️  No test results file generated
```
**Cause**: Your project doesn't have a `tests` directory or tests

### 3. ⚠️ SonarQube Scan Failing
```
ERROR Invalid value of sonar.tests for ***_demo-fastapi_6ba235ba-ff96-459d-8607-919121b2ad98
ERROR The folder 'tests' does not exist
```
**Cause**: Workflow was hardcoded to look for tests directory

### 4. ⚠️ Python venv Issues
```
The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not available
apt install python3.10-venv
```
**Cause**: Runner doesn't have `python3-venv` package

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Workflow Updated
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-self-hosted.yaml`

✓ **SonarQube**: Now checks if `tests` directory exists before adding it to scan
✓ **Tests**: Now skips gracefully if no tests directory or requirements.txt
✓ **Deployment Marking**: Now provides helpful error message if datadog-ci missing

### Fix 2: Runner Setup Guide Created
**File**: `RUNNER_SETUP_FIX.md`

Provides 3 options to fix the runner:
1. Quick fix: Install in running container
2. Startup script: Persistent fix
3. Docker Compose update: Best practice

---

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Option A: Quick Fix (5 minutes)

SSH to your GMKTec server:

```bash
# Enter container as root
docker exec -u root -it github-runner-prod bash

# Install Node.js 20.x
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs python3-venv

# Install datadog-ci
npm install -g @datadog/datadog-ci

# Verify
node --version        # Should show v20.x.x
datadog-ci version    # Should show version number

# Exit
exit
```

### Option B: Persistent Fix (Recommended)

Update your `docker-compose.yml` to install dependencies on startup.

See `RUNNER_SETUP_FIX.md` for the complete docker-compose configuration.

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Next Workflow Run Will Show:

✅ **Datadog CI Installation**:
```
✓ Node.js already installed: v20.x.x
✓ npm available: 10.x.x
✓ datadog-ci installed: X.X.X
datadog_ci_available=true
```

✅ **Tests** (will skip gracefully):
```
⚠️  No tests directory found - skipping tests
tests_generated=false
```

✅ **SonarQube**:
```
⚠️  No tests directory found, skipping test analysis
[continues with code analysis only]
```

✅ **Deployment Marking**:
```
✓ Found datadog-ci: X.X.X
✅ Deployment marked successfully in Datadog

## 🔍 Testing After Fix

### 1. Commit These Changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update workflow to handle missing tests and install datadog-ci"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Watch the Workflow Run:
Go to: https://github.com/quickstark/demo-fastapi/actions

### 3. Check for Success Messages:
- ✅ Datadog CI installed
- ✅ Tests skipped gracefully (no errors)
- ✅ SonarQube scan passes
- ✅ Deployment marked in Datadog

### 4. Verify in Datadog:
Visit: https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/services/demo-fastapi/deployments?env=development

You should see a new deployment marker!

## 📝 Notes

### About Tests
Your project currently has no `tests` directory. When you add tests:

1. Create `tests/` directory
2. Add test files (e.g., `test_main.py`)
3. Tests will automatically run in future workflows

### About Deployment Markers
Once Node.js is installed:
- Future deployments will be tracked in Datadog APM
- You'll see deployment events correlated with performance changes
- Useful for tracking which releases introduced issues

### About Test Results
When you add tests:
- Test results will automatically upload to Datadog CI Visibility
- You'll see test pass/fail trends
- Failed tests will be tracked and reported

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### datadog-ci Still Not Found?

```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
docker exec github-runner-prod node --version

# If not found, install again
docker exec -u root github-runner-prod bash -c "curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs"

# Install datadog-ci
docker exec -u root github-runner-prod npm install -g @datadog/datadog-ci

# Verify
docker exec github-runner-prod datadog-ci version
```

### Workflow Still Failing?

Check the specific error in the GitHub Actions logs and:
1. Look for the step that failed
2. Read the error message
3. Follow the troubleshooting hints in the logs

### Need More Help?

## ✅ Success Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Node.js installed in runner (`docker exec github-runner-prod node --version`)
- [ ] npm available (`docker exec github-runner-prod npm --version`)
- [ ] datadog-ci installed (`docker exec github-runner-prod datadog-ci version`)
- [ ] python3-venv installed (`docker exec github-runner-prod python3 -m venv --help`)
- [ ] Workflow completes without errors
- [ ] Deployment appears in Datadog
- [ ] No red X's in workflow run

**Current Status**: ⚠️ Workflow runs but missing features (test results, deployment tracking)

**After Fix**: ✅ Full Datadog CI integration working

**Time to Fix**: ~5-10 minutes
